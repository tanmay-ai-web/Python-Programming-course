# Write a python program to calculate the square of a number entered by the user.


a = int(input("Enter your number: ")) 


print("The square of the number is", a**2)
print("The square of the number is", a*a)


# a*a   and    a**a    is same when it comes to square of the number 
# print("The square of the number is", a^2) # Incorrect for finding square of a number in Python
